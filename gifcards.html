          My AR project consists of a small trigger image printed on paper and a gif that overlays the trigger. I was inspired by wealth inequality when thinking about what my project but I then I changed my focus to the effects of globalism.
          Asetheticaly, I was striving for my project to resemble modern business marketing ads. They usually consist of dark cool colors and depict some feeling of prosperity.

          Globalism has brought new products and ideas together from around the world, however, it has amplified an unequal balance in wealth and power. I wanted the viewer to feel the growning financial instability of middle and lower class
          Americans. I was influenced by Scott Galloway who does economical analysis on YouTube. Galloway talks about the winners and losers in the current economy but also goes into the effects they have on people.
