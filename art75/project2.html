          Everyone relies only on a couple companies in their everyday life. The apps that Facebook, Amazon, and Google offer have become irreplaceable to us. It’s hard to imagine what life would be like with these Silicon Valley tech companies, however this discussion has been growing. Institutions are catching on to the power that the companies have on our lives and the economy.

          With my video installation, I wanted to tie in religion with the big tech companies. Facebook, Amazon, and Google are the subjects of this piece because they’re the most influential companies in our everyday lives. The church is meant to convey the grand scale of the three companies. I wanted the viewer to think about the power the three companies have and how they would live without them.

          What are the alternatives to Google Maps or Amazon Prime? What service is comparable to Youtube or contains a member base as big as Facebook? These are questions we all know the answer to but never ask ourselves.
